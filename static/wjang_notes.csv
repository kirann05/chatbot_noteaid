**INSTITUTION CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY DISCHARGE SUMMARY PATIENT NAME : **NAME[AAA , BBB M] ACCOUNT # : **ID-NUM **ROOM ATTENDING PHYSICIAN : **NAME[YYY M ZZZ] ADMISSION DATE : **DATE[ Jan 02 2008 ] DISCHARGE DATE : **DATE[ Jan 05 2008 ] ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS : RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS : STATUS POST RIGHT PLEURAL DRAINAGE VIA PIGTAIL CATHETER .
ADMITTING PHYSICIAN : **NAME[YYY ZZZ] , M.D.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED : 1 .
On **DATE[ Jan 02 08] , the patient underwent an insertion of right pleural drainage catheter at the bedside . 2.
On **DATE[ Jan 04 08] , the patient underwent percutaneous drainage with ultrasound guidance of his right chest .
REASON FOR ADMISSION : In summary , this patient is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old male who was referred from Dr. **NAME[UUU] to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] for this right pleural effusion .
The patient was seen in the office of Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[ Dec 22 07] .
At this time , he was asymptomatic from his pleural effusion , which was an incidental finding on a chest x-ray around this time at a routine office visit .
The patient 's past medical history is significant for myocardial infarction in 2003 , at which time he also apparently fell , struck his head , and had a significant brain injury .
While the patient was in the office , Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] believed that the best treatment for his patient was thorascopic surgery for pleural biopsies , evaluation of the pleural space , and drainage of the pleural effusion .
However , due to the patient 's significant comorbidities , Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] , at this time , felt that it would be wiser to start with a bedside pleural drainage with a pleural pigtail placed under local anesthesia .
The patient came to the hospital on **DATE[ Jan 02 08 ] and underwent insertion of a right pigtail catheter by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] and myself .
At this time , we did drain approximately 100 mL of clear yellow fluid , which were sent for cytology and culture .
The pigtail was then hooked to a PLEURAvac , which did not have any drainage over the next 24 hours .
At this time , it was decided by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] that the patient undergo a CT scan of his chest to evaluate the location of the pigtail and also the size of the pleural effusion .
CT of the chest done on **DATE[ Jan 03 08 ] revealed that the pigtail itself was actually not in the pleural space .
We attribute this to the difficulty we had inserting the pigtail due to increased resistance , which Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] believes is secondary to severe pleural fibrosis .
However , at the time the pigtail was placed , we did obtain 100 mL of drainage .
After the CT scan was obtained on **DATE[ Jan 03 08] , the patient underwent a new pigtail placement under ultrasound guidance on **DATE[ Jan 04 08] .
Once this pigtail was placed , 450 mL of clear yellowish fluid were drained from the patient 's chest on **DATE[ Jan 04 08] .
This amount of drainage was noted when we did rounds this morning .
The patient , at this time , has drained only 15 mL over the past 4 to 5 hours .
At this time , it was decided that the pigtail be discontinued from the patient 's chest and the patient will be discharged home today in stable condition .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS : He is to be on a regular diet .
He is to increase his activity slowly and as tolerated .
He is to keep his dressing intact until Sunday and then he may change his dressing and use plain gauze and tape to keep it covered .
He should keep this wound covered until it begins to scab over .
He is to continue his incentive spirometer treatments for 1 week .
He may shower after today .
He should not take tub baths for 4 weeks .
He should not smoke .
He is to call our office if he notices a temperature elevation greater than 101 degrees or a sustained low grade temperature of 99 degrees or high , if he has a fever associated with chills , increased swelling , redness , or drainage at or around the incision sites , or increased shortness of breath , new onset chest pain , difficult swallowing , severe calf pain , lightheadedness , dizziness , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , unusual rashes , or burning on urination .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS : The patient is not prescribed any new medications .
However , he is encouraged to continue all of his home medications as they were previously prescribed .
FOLLOW UP : He is also to follow up with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[ Jan 23]nd at 10 a.m. at the **INSTITUTION.
He is to report to the 1st floor for his x-ray and then he is to come to the 2nd floor for his appointment . __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ **NAME[YYY M ZZZ] , M.D.

**INSTITUTION GENERAL MEDICINE DISCHARGE SUMMARY PATIENT NAME : **NAME[AAA , BBB M] ACCOUNT # : **ID-NUM **ROOM ATTENDING PHYSICIAN : **NAME[YYY M ZZZ] ADMISSION DATE : **DATE[Apr 06 2007] DISCHARGE DATE : REASON FOR ADMISSION/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old , white female with diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , Crohn 's disease , DVT , status post IVC filter , MI with two stents , COPD , history of CVAs , and a history of chronic pain , who presented with a three-day history of increasing left chest pain radiating to her back .
She described it as constant , 7/10 , worse at night and with exercise , and relieved by rest .
No nausea , vomiting , or URI symptoms .
She just complained of burning with urination for three days and also complained of diarrhea , watery and nonbloody , for 10 days which is consistent with her Crohn 's disease .
She had been admitted from **DATE[ Mar 16 2007] to **DATE[ Mar 21 2007] with similar symptoms .
At that time , she was found to have an E. coli UTI and a large renal calculus that was perceived to be chronic .
She has been started on Macrobid .
On admission this time , she also complained of increasing redness on her lower right extremity and some vulvar itching .
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY : 1 .
Peripheral vascular disease .
The patient is status post a left AKA and a right fem-pop bypass with external iliac shunt .
She was last seen by Vascular Surgery in the **DATE[ Mar ] visit of 2006 .
At that time , they had found that her pain in that leg which persists was most likely chronic and would not be helped by an additional surgery . 2.
DVT , status post IVC filter placement .
She was on Coumadin , but had hematoma on the Coumadin therapy , and thus , IVC filter placement in 2005 .
Subsequently , she was found to have a clot and was restarted on the Coumadin therapy .
Her INR on admission was 1.0, although she states she had been taking her medication .
The IVC filter is still in place . 3.
Coronary artery disease and status post MI . 4 .
Chronic joint disease . 5 .
Chronic pain . 6 .
Depression . 7.
Crohn 's disease . 8.
CVAs in 2004 and 2006 . 9 .
Cataract surgery . 10 .
COPD. 11 .
Hyperglycemia , either due to diabetes type 2 or steroid induced sugar control issues .
LABORATORY , RADIOGRAPHIC , AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC STUDY FINDINGS : CONSULTS : Home health .
PROCEDURES : None .
COMPLICATIONS : None .
IMAGING : 1 .
The patient could not have a CT to rule out a PE due to her IV contrast allergy .
She did have a right leg Doppler which showed no DVT. 2.
EKG was unchanged from prior . 3.
Chest x-ray was unchanged from prior .
LABORATORY : The patient 's INR on admission was 1.0.
Her INR on discharge was 1.5 .
Her blood sugars on a low-dose sliding scale ranged from 118 to 159 .
Her white count was within normal limits , ranged from 4.6 to 6.0, and her hemoglobin was within normal limits .
Urinalysis was negative .
It had 2+ leukocyte esterase , but rare urine bacteria .
It did have moderate budding yeast , and the urine culture showed yeast .
HOSPITAL COURSE : 1 .
CV-HEME.
A PE could not be ruled out .
The patient was started on a heparin drip from **DATE[Apr 06 2007] to day of discharge .
It was felt that since she should be anticoagulated anyway , she should be started back on her Coumadin therapy , coumadinized , as well as heparinized .
She had no acute EKG changes .
Her troponins were negative .
It was likely chronic pain versus a new PE.
Her blood pressure was controlled throughout her stay with her home dose of metoprolol 25 mg p.o . b.i.d .
Her hemoglobin was stable on Coumadin and heparin drip . 2.
ID.
The patient remained afebrile with a low white count throughout her stay .
There were no signs of pneumonia on her chest x-ray .
She had been diagnosed with a UTI during her last admission , but she should have finished her Macrobid before admission to the hospital this time .
Although a urinalysis was suspicious for possible infection , urine culture grew out only yeast .
She was started on Monistat .
She should take this one per vagina q.h .s . for seven days .
She had been on Flagyl upon admission , but had not been told of a recent diagnosis of C. difficile .
The laboratory here did not have any C. difficile toxins , and thus , we stopped the Flagyl without further reason to continue it .
Cellulitis .
The patient was maintained on vancomycin with significantly less redness of her leg throughout the hospital stay .
It was decided it was most likely a cellulitis , and she would continue linezolid to complete a seven-day course of antibiotics as an outpatient . 3.
GI.
The patient 's blood sugars were controlled on a sliding scale .
It is likely that her blood sugar control issues are related to the steroids she is on and not due to diabetes type 2.
She tolerated a regular diet . 4 .
GU.
As above .
The patient was found to have a yeast infection which contaminated her urine culture .
She was to have Monistat treatment . 5 .
NEUROLOGIC.
The patient has chronic pain issues .
She has been tried on multiple medications in the past , including methadone without much success .
Her current regimen is Percocet two q . four scheduled around the clock .
It seems to work for her well enough .
She is at her baseline pain control on the day of admission .
She did have some significant pain in her right lower extremity .
The patient 's leg pain did decrease with treatment of her cellulitis .
She is to continue treatment for another four days to complete a seven-day course of antibiotics .

6 .
PULMONARY .
The patient 's sats were good on her home 02 of 2 liters nasal cannula .
She had no significant issues .
Although a PE could not be ruled out , it was neither ruled in .
She will be anticoagulated for the risk of PE , as well as her baseline need for anticoagulation .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS : 1 .
ALLERGIES : TAPE , IV DYE , PENICILLIN. 2.
Medications at home on discharge : ( a ) Percocet .
( b ) Lipitor .
( c ) Coumadin 2.5 daily .
( d ) Albuterol .
( e ) Clonazepam .

She is to follow up with Dr. **NAME[VVV] 's office on Thursday for an INR , and then he will follow her coags until she is therapeutic on her Coumadin , and once again , she can stop the Lovenox at that time .
She was given this appointment .
She already had a standing appointment on **DATE[ May 05] .
I believe it was written in her discharge instructions . 4 .
The patient was told to return for chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , fever , diarrhea , chills , or any other significant symptoms .
All of patient 's questions were answered .

**INSTITUTION TRANSPLANT SURGERY DISCHARGE SUMMARY PATIENT NAME : **NAME[AAA , BBB M] ACCOUNT # : **ID-NUM **ROOM ATTENDING PHYSICIAN : RON **NAME[ZZZ] ADMISSION DATE : **DATE[ Mar 06 2007] DISCHARGE DATE : **DATE[ Mar 08 2007] REASON FOR ADMISSION : Hyperglycemia after steroid infusion .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old male , status post a living-related kidney transplant in **DATE[ Jun ] of 2006 who had a biopsy on **DATE[ Mar 03 07] that showed BANFF 1A to 1B rejection .
He was given a dose of 500 mg of Solu-Medrol as an outpatient on Friday on 7-West and his fasting blood sugars went up into the mid 200s .
On **DATE[ Mar 06 07] , when he was seen on the outpatient unit , his blood sugars were found to be 450 thus he was admitted to the hospital for blood sugar control during treatment of his rejection .
He received 500 mg of Solu-Medrol on 7-West on Saturday and then received another gram of Solu-Medrol once his blood sugars were better maintained .
He was continued on his 26 units of 70/30 insulin b.i.d . but also had moderate dose sliding scale insulin added .
On **DATE[ Mar 08 07] , creatinine was coming down slightly to a level of 2.3 .
His baseline is 2.1 .

**INSTITUTION TRANSPLANT SURGERY DISCHARGE SUMMARY PATIENT NAME : **NAME[AAA , BBB M] ACCOUNT # : **ID-NUM **ROOM ATTENDING PHYSICIAN : RON **NAME[ZZZ] ADMISSION DATE : **DATE[Aug 25 2007] DISCHARGE DATE : **DATE[Aug 30 2007] **INSTITUTION COURSE : This is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old female who was admitted on **DATE[Aug 25 2007] and discharged on **DATE[Aug 30 2007] .
She is status post a cadavaric renal transplant secondary to MPGN done on **DATE[ Nov 17 2005] .
She was admitted with symptomatic anemia .
She was having lightheadedness , dizziness and shortness of breath with exertion at home .
She had had a hemoglobin done on **DATE[ Jun 14] which was 12.6 and then **DATE[ Jul 05 ] had decreased to 11.2 and on **DATE[Aug 16 2007] it had fallen to 7.8.
She denied any source of obvious bleeding .
No bright red blood per rectum , no nausea , vomiting , blood in emesis .
Also significant to this admission was that patient was treated with Campath in **DATE[Oct ] of 2006 for cellular rejection and she also was diagnosed with recurrent MPGN in **DATE[ Jan ] of 2006 .
Her baseline creatinine currently is around 2.3 to 2.5 .
Though she was admitted and was given one unit of packed red blood cells on **DATE[Aug 26 2007] , her hemoglobin responded appropriately and went up to 8.9 and 25.9 and it has continued to rise throughout her stay to a high of 9.3 and 27.2 .
On the day of discharge , it fell slightly to 8.9 and 26.3 .
The patient was asymptomatic without shortness of breath and no lightheadedness and dizziness after .
Her H&amp;H improved .
On admission , a haptoglobin level was obtained which was fine .
Vitamin B12 level was obtained and folate was obtained , all of which came back normal .
She had a chest x-ray which was negative for any consolidation effusions .
Her electrolytes were __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ throughout her stay .
She was restarted on p.o . iron .
We used Niferex 150 mg p.o . b.i.d . as well as restarting her Procrit 10,000 units subcu three times a week .
GI Medicine was consulted due to the drop in her H&amp;H.
They decided to do an EGD and a colonoscopy .
The EGD showed mild distal esophagitis as well as an extrinsic compression of the fundus for which they recommended a CT of her abdomen and pelvis without contrast .
The colonoscopy showed diverticula in the descending colon and small internal hemorrhoids , but otherwise unremarkable .
She was then started on Protonix 40 mg p.o . q . day .
The patient was previously on Zantac q . day .
This was discontinued .
The CT scan showed a posterior nodular bulge of the spleen , most likely a lobulation of a normal spleen .
It was , however , noted that if they cannot completely rule out any focal lesions and if it is clinically necessary , they would recommend a technetium spleen scan to rule out any nodular abnormality .
It was decided that the patient will be discharged home because her anemia is stable .
She feels well , she is ambulating well , she is tolerating a regular diet .
She is not complaining of any shortness of breath , that she will follow up in clinic in one to two weeks and follow up with an outpatient hematologist to better evaluate her anemia if it continues and then due to the questionable findings on the CT scan , to have a repeat CT scan in three months .
GI also recommended that the patient be on a high fiber diet .
Also before discharge , we drew an EBV , PCR , SCB , CMB PCR to be tested and followed up as an outpatient .
Her kidney function was stable throughout her stay .
Her creatinine ranged in the 2.1 to 2.3 range throughout her stay .

She said that she will call and make that appointment in one to two weeks .
She also said that she would try contacting her PCP for a hematology referral and to find someone close to her area .
