HISTORY OF PRESENT STAY : Mr. **NAME[AAA ] is a **AGE[in 40s]-year-old male who underwent a cadaveric liver transplant **DATE[ Mar 7 2007] , secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis .
He had a fairly routine postoperative course .
He was recently readmitted on **DATE[Apr 1]st with vague neurologic symptoms , including headache , slurred speech , and tremors .
He had a neurologic workup this time , including CT scan and the neuro workup was negative .
It was decided to take him off of Prograf and switch him over to cyclosporin , assuming that Prograf was the cause of these neuro side effects .
We also added him on CellCept 1 g p.o . b.i.d . at that time .
He was discharged 2 days later on **DATE[Apr 3]rd .
On **DATE[Apr 6]th , he was readmitted with an elevation of his liver function tests .
When his Prograf and cyclosporin levels were both checked on admission , the Prograf was negative and the cyclosporin was also less than 45 .
We immediately increased his cyclosporin dose and scheduled him for a liver biopsy .
He underwent liver biopsy on **DATE[Apr 6]th and it showed cholestasis , bile ductular proliferation with mixed portal and spotty lobular inflammation , and focal mild portal edema .
It also showed mild acute cellular rejection with an REI of 3 out of 9 .
The biopsy results were delayed by a day due to a mistake with either radiology or pathology lab with locating the sample .
Two days after biopsy was taken , the results came back .
He was then treated with Solu-Medrol 1 g IV x1 dose .
We also maximized his cyclosporin .
After the gram of Solu-Medrol , Mr. **NAME[AAA ] experienced hyperglycemia .
He had blood sugars that maximized at 440 .
He was put on a moderate dose insulin sliding scale to treat the side effects of the Solu-Medrol .
He tolerated the insulin well and within 24 hours , had a significant decline in his blood sugars to normal levels in the 150s and 160s .
Today , he is being discharged with a level of 153 this morning .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS : He will be discharged to home with cyclosporin 350 mg p.o . b.i.d . and CellCept 1000 mg p.o . b.i.d .

His condition was stable .
We increased his lactulose to q.3 h . p.r.n . with appropriate resolution of symptoms .
On the day of discharge , his shaking had stopped , although he was complaining of increased bowel movements which is an acceptable side effect of lactulose and to be expected .
The patient was discharged in stable condition with his tremor resolved and had a followup on **DATE[ Jan 3 2008] , to see his gastroenterologist .
For the rest of the hospital course , please see the hospital course by systems .

**INSTITUTION NEUROLOGY DISCHARGE SUMMARY

PATIENT NAME : **NAME[AAA , BBB M] ACCOUNT # : **ID-NUM **ROOM ATTENDING PHYSICIAN : **NAME[YYY] **NAME[ZZZ] ADMISSION DATE : **DATE[ Jan 08 2008 ] DISCHARGE DATE : **DATE[ Jan 13 2008 ]


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS : Postherpetic neuralgia .

PROCEDURES : Procedures that were done , the patient had a spinal tap on **DATE[ Jan 11 2008] .
She had an MRI of her head on **DATE[ Jan 9 2008] , that showed mild to moderate white matters , small-vessel ischemic changes , as well as normal optic nerves , and chiasms .
She had an MRI of her C- and T-spine on **DATE[ Jan 10 2008] , that showed degenerative changes in the thoracic spine with some variable appearance to the bone marrow , but there were no enhancing abnormalities in either the cervical or the thoracic spine .
She had an EMG as well as nerve conduction studies on **DATE[ Jan 9 2008] .

CONSULTS : Consults that were obtained ; there was Pain Management consult obtained on **DATE[ Jan 10 2008] , as well as the Cardiology consult obtained on **DATE[ Jan 13 2008] .

HOSPITAL COURSE : This is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old female with a history of vasculitic neuropathy previously treated with methotrexate , CellCept , and Rituxan , who then developed zoster in **DATE[ Dec 2007] , and was treated with Valtrex .
Then , at the end of the year , who presented with severe postherpetic neuralgia .
Please refer to the Neurology H and P for further details on presentation .
Hospital course issues are as follows : 1 .
For the pain management .
The Neurontin was increased to 1200 mg t.i.d .
The Depakote was increased to 750 q.8 hours . , and she was put on oral Dilaudid as well as lidocaine patch .
Over the course of her hospital stay , her pain was extremely difficult to control until the day of discharge , when she said that the pain was responding to the oral Dilaudid .
A Chronic Pain consult was obtained .
They recommended outpatient followup in the **INSTITUTION as well as a Fentanyl patch , which was then added on the **DATE[ Jan 10 2008] . 2.
When she had presented , she also had right arm weakness .
So we obtained an MRI of her head and of her cervical and thoracic spine as well as EMG and nerve conduction studies .
Being that the EMG that was obtained on the **DATE[ Jan 9 2008 ] was consistent with the possible right lower trunk brachial plexopathy versus radiculopathy .
We obtained an MRI of her upper spine .
The MRI did not show any nerve impingement , and so an LP was performed , which was negative .
So in summary , the entire workup for her right upper extremity weakness suggested possible post hereptic changes to the lower trunk of the right brachial plexus .
The weakness may have improved by **DATE[ Jan 11 2008] , and it possible that there was a component due to pain . 3.
On **DATE[ Jan 12 2008] , the patient 's PCP Dr. **NAME[TTT] had one of her partners stop by to leave a note in the chart saying that on **DATE[ Dec 23 2007] , she had had a cardiac stress test that showed possible high risk for coronary artery disease and ischemia , and so she had recommended a Cardiology consult .
The Cardiology consult was obtained on the **DATE[ Jan 13 2008] , and the Cardiology fellow , who saw the patient , said that actually in reviewing the stress test , it is only really mildly positive and is actually a low-risk positive stress test .
He recommended that we increase her Lopressor to 50 mg b.i.d. , and increased her aspirin to 325 mg daily and has her follow up with Cardiology for an outpatient left heart catheterization .

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS : Discharge instructions are as follows ; the patient is being discharged to home with a diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia .
Condition is stable .
ALLERGIES ARE TO BACTRIM , LISINOPRIL , TEGRETOL , AND NYSTATIN.
Activity is ad lib .
