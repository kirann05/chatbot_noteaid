FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates nodular contour with coarse 
echotexture,
consistent with known history of cirrhosis. Again seen is a 
2.6-cm cyst with septation in the left hepatic lobe, unchanged 
since the prior study. A second solid lesion seen in the segment 
II of the liver, is not imaged in the current study. The patient 
is status post-cholecystectomy. There is no intrahepatic biliary 
dilatation. The common bile duct measures 7 mm. There is no free 
fluid.
 
Color Doppler and pulse Doppler images were obtained. The main 
portal vein
has normal hepatopetal flow. The TIPS shunt is patent and 
demonstrates
wall-to-wall flow. The flow velocities in the proximal, mid and 
distal portion of the TIPS are 122, 144, 149 cm/sec 
respectively. Flow in the left portal vein was directed towards 
the shunt.
 
IMPRESSION: Patent TIPS shunt with wall to wall flow. Expected 
hepatopedal
flow in the main and hepatofugal flow in the left portal vein. 
No ascites.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Lower GI Bleed - Although stools were guiac positve in house, it 
was unlikely that she has had a significant GI bleed and she 
remained hemodyanmically stable throughout her hospitalization 
without additional episodes of melena or hematochezia. It was 
more likely that she may have slow, not hemodyanmically 
significant, oozing that presisted despite TIPS procedure. Liver 
ultrasound revealed patent TIPS with normal flow.  Received 1 U 
PRBC transfusion prior to discharge for a HCT of 23.8. 
*Should reassess CBC on follow up

Alcohol use: Patient continues to abuse alcohol, evidenced by 
her intoxicated presentation and BAL of 191 on admission. Social 
work was consulted to offer additional information about 
available services, although patient declined. She had no 
symptoms of withdrawal during this admission she was maintained 
on an oral MVI, thiamine and folate supplement.  Urged patient 
to continue alcohol cessation, although she claims she uses it 
for pain management as her pain is """"poorly controlled"""".  Of 
note, refused Tyelenol in house for pain relief.   
*Assess for alcohol abstinence 

Alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy: Her admission 
MELD was 6. She has no previous ascites on ultrasound, none was 
evident on admission. She did not appear to have decompensated 
cirrhosis. Her lactulose dose was titrated to achieve 3 bowel 
movements daily and she was continued on her home rifaximin 
dose. She was also continued on her home pantoprazole dose.
.
Pancytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis. All Levels were elevated on 
admission in the setting of hemoconcentration and normalized to 
her outpatient baseline following hydration.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  Continues to drink alcohol.  Very tearful 
and emotional over necessity of taking lactulose.  Also 
unsatisfied with pain control for tooth pain, although 
procedures were over 2 weeks ago and should have minimal pain as 
appear well healed.  Refused Tyelonol in house and requested 
narcotics.  Held narcotics due to mental status changes that 
could occur.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, she underwent Segment V mass resection and 
intraoperative ultrasound for hepatic adenoma. An epidural was 
placed for pain control. Surgeon was Dr. ___. 
Operative findings were noted: solitary mass in segment V of the 
liver that on gross appearance looked like a hepatic adenoma. 
Frozen section confirmed probable hepatic adenoma. 
Intraoperative ultrasound demonstrated no other lesions in the 
liver. Intraoperative ultrasound after the mass was enucleated 
demonstrated no residual tumor tissue. Please refer to operative 
note for details. Postop, epidural was ineffective for pain 
control. IV Morphine was given then switched to IV dilaudid with 
improved control. The epidural was removed on ___. 

She spiked a temperature to 101 on postop day 1 attributed to 
atelectasis, but blood cultures were sent and were negative to 
date. UA was negative and urine culture was negative. 

LFTs increased slightly then trended down. Diet was slowly 
advanced. She was assisted to ambulate and needed a lot of 
encouragement to do this as well as with the incentive 
spirometer. The incision remained intact, clean and dry. 

On ___, she became dizzy, desat'd to ___ with increased heart 
rate to 120. This improved once back in bed. A CXR was done 
noting near-complete collapse of the right lower lobe presumably 
due to mucus plugging. Aggressive incentive spirometer was 
encouraged. She remained overnight for observation. Augmentin 
was started for RLL pneumonia. O2 sats improved as well as 
dizziness. Other vitals were stable. 

She was discharged to home on Augmentin in stable condition. A 
script for oral dilaudid was provided. She was encouraged to 
decrease the dose.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ w/ h/o HTN, HLD, ?___ p/w sudden onset 
confusion and found to have hypertensive emergency.

# Acute hypertensive encephalopathy: Had word finding 
difficulty, without other focal findings. Neuro c/s thought 
unlikely to be stroke. Most likely due to hypertensive 
encephalopathy. DDx include hypertensive encephalopathy vs. 
metabolic/toxic vs. PRES vs. CVA vs infection vs. delirium vs. 
medication-induced. Infectious cause less likely given UA and 
CXR negative. TSH normal and RPR negative on last admission. 
NCHCT and CTA not concerning for acute stroke. MRI showed no 
acute hemorrhage or ischemic injury. Since pt has had similar 
presentations in the past (expressive aphasia) and 
confusion/disorientation w/ hypertension and ischemic w/u has 
been negative, this is most likely d/t hypertension as well. 
PRES less likely given headaches are frontal, no VS, no seizure. 
At time of discharge, his mental status improved but he still 
occasionally was confused and forgetful with word finding 
difficulties.

# Hypertensive emergency: BP initially elevated to 220 systolic. 
Treated in the MICU initially with IV labetalol in addition to 
restarting home meds. Most likely d/t poor compliance with 
medications v secondary causes of HTN. When transferred to the 
floor, his home atenolol was replaced with labetalol for better 
blood pressure effect and uptitrated as needed and his 
lisinopril was uptitrated to 40mg from 20mg. His isosorbide 
mononitrate was uptitrated. He was started on nifedipine as 
well. On discharge BPs were 130s-150s. Goal SBP 130-160mmHg. 

# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin 

# Anemia: H&H at baseline. Most likely d/t vit B12 deficiency. 
continue vit B12. 

# Chronic diastolic CHF: TTE done in ___ did not show any 
sign of CHF. EF>55% with mild MR and mild pulmonary HTN. Based 
on records, Lasix and metolazone are most likely for ___ edema. 
His home diuretics were held on discharge because patient was 
euvolemic during this admission. Also, he had ___ with acute 
rise in creatinine after re-starting his diuretics.

# Shoulder/back pain: History of disc herniation and shoulder 
pain. Patient is treated with Tylenol prn for pain. Narcotics 
were avoided given altered mental status. 

Transitional issues:
- medication compliance
- f/u as outpatient whether to re-start metolazone and 
- Follow urine/plasma metanephrines
- give 20mg PO hydralazine if SBP >180mmHg
- give 20mg IV hydralazine if SBP >200mmHg and notify MD
- uptitrate nifedipine v. isosorbide mononitrate as needed for 
improved BP control.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was brought to ___ for trauma 
evaluation. A chest tube was in place on the left side upon 
arrival. He was resuscitated per ACLS protocol in the trauma bay 
and determined to have hypotension, a positive fast exam and a 
rigid abdomen. After receiving antibiotics and tetanus, he was 
taken emergently to the operating room for a laparotomy. See 
operative report for full details. After a brief stay in the 
PACU, he was transferred to the floor.

Neuro: The patient received a dilaudid PCA with good effect and 
adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient 
was transitioned to oral pain medications. He continued to have 
difficulty mobilizing due to pain and toradol was added to his 
pain regimen briefly.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. He was placed 
on telemetry postoperatively and this was discontinued on POD2.

Pulmonary: The patient arrived with a left sided chest tube in 
place. Output was routinely monitored and CXR was obtained daily 
to monitor for pneumothorax. He remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. On ___, his chest tube 
was removed. Repeat CXR showed no reaccumulation of his 
pneumothorax.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. Foley was 
removed on POD2. The patient failed to void x2, foley was 
replaced, and he was given flomax. Another voiding trial was 
attempted on POD3 which was successful. The patient was 
subsequently able to void spontaneously.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. He received 
perioperative doses of cefazolin, flagyl and fluconazole.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible. He also received protonix 
for ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient worked with physical therapy during his stay to 
improve his strength and mobility. At the time of discharge, he 
was afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, walking without assistance, and with his 
pain well controled.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY.

This is a ___ with DM2 (a1c 7.8), HTN, chronic kidney disease, 
prostate cancer, sickle cell trait, mild transaminitis  with 
prior heavy alcohol use, and recent urinary tract obstruction 
thought due to BPH s/p foley catheterization, who presented with 
hematuria and bladder outlet obstruction, found to have UTI. He 
was treated with 3 way foley and CBI until clots cleared. Foley 
was then removed to limit further trauma and he passed a voiding 
trial prior to discharge. He was treated with IV antibiotics for 
UTI, transitioned to cipro on discharge.

DETAILED SUMMARY.

# Groin pain
# Hematuria with
# Bladder outlet obstruction
# UTI: He was admitted to ___ ___ for obstructive uropathy. A 
foley was placed at that time and he had improvement in renal 
function and he was discharged with outpatient followup. Now 
coming in with gross hematuria with clots obstructing foley. DDx 
foley trauma, friability from prior radiation, new cancer, 
hemorrhagic infectious cystitis. Improved with CBI via 3 way 
foley. Due to concerns for cystitis, foley was removed. He 
passed a voiding trial prior to discharge. He was treated with 
IV CTX initially but is being discharged on cipro as urine 
culture showed pansusceptible Klebsiella. 
- Complete course of cipro
- Follow up with ___ urology as below

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr is 1.5-1.8, was up 
to 2.4 two weeks ago when he had the initial obstructive 
uropathy. It had apparently improved and he had been restarted 
on his Lasix/Lisinopril a few days ago. Creatinine down to 1.5 
prior to discharge. Held Lasix and Lisinopril here given 
recurrent ___.
- Continuing to hold diuretic/ACE at discharge

# Acute blood loss anemia: Initially mildly anemic but Hb 
progressively decreasedto 7 range and then remained stable. 
Never required transfusion. Likely related to acute blood loss, 
though could have mild underlying anemia of chronic disease in 
setting of CKD. Asymptomatic including with ambulation.

# HTN
# HL: Stable. Continued atorvastatin. Continued atorvastatin. 
Continued amlodipine and metoprolol, but increased amlodipine to 
10mg for BP control while off ACE/diuretic.

# DM2 now with hyperglycemia: Takes glipizide at home. Had some 
FSBGs >300 here but improved with adjustments to insulin. 
Hyperglycemia may be related to underlying infection, improved. 
Resumed glipizide at discharge.

>30 minutes spent coordinating discharge home

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was admitted to ___ from ___ 
___ for surgical eval of esophageal perforation. Dr. 
___ lengthy discussion w/ family and a plan for 
aggressive non-operative  management was made based on pt's age 
DNR/DNI status pre- hospitalization and co-morbidities. She was 
started on Vanco/Zosyn, fluconazole. on HD #1 and a covered 
esophageal stent was placed. She was weaned and extubated on 
HD#2 without difficulty.  Pt was transferred from the ICU and 
TPN was started on HD#3.  On HD#6 she was taken to the OR for 
Exploratory laparotomy; placement of open tube gastrostomy (22 
Malecot); placement of open tube jejunostomy ___ 
whistle-tip); gastric biopsy. Pt tolerated procedure well but 
was found to have what appeared to be Poorly differentiated 
adenocarcinoma of unknown primary confirmed by by pathology. 
Oncology was consulted and their recommendation was that 
aggressive measures including chemo or further surgery would not 
be beneficial.  An esophageal stent was placed over the area of 
perforation.  Initially pt's right chest tubes were draining 
serosanguinous drainage in small/mod amounts but on approx HD # 
9 the drainage increased and became bilious. It was thought that 
her esophageal stent had migrated. She was sent for a EGD and 
the stent was repositioned. Subsequently the drainage decreased 
and over the next few days became very pale green, thick and 
cloudy. Her leucocytosis resolved over the course of the ensuing 
days and she remained afebrile. A left sided pleural effusion 
was seen on CXR and a left chest tube was placed and 
subsequently d/c'd when the effusion resolved.  She was 
transfused 2 UPRBC for anemia. HCT has remained stable ~ ___. 
Left PICC line placed ___. She was maintained on broad spectrum 
IVAB Vanco, Zosyn, Caspo which she will need to complete a 6 
week course. TPN was d/c'd and tube feeds were started and 
increased to goal. ___ multiple discussions with 
pt's family through out her hospital stay re: her prognosis and 
course of treatment. A decision was made to continue treatment 
so long as she continued to respond. Hospice was also consulted 
but her, niece who is her proxy, ___ wanted to continue 
current CT and IVAB management.

___, who presented after a fall on ___.

He had a fall on ___ at home. He does not remember how he fell, 
but he subsequently got himself back up and was feeling well. 
However, the next morning, on ___, he was complaining of 
dizziness, so his home health aide brought him in to be seen. CT 
scan at ___ Urgent Care showed a small subdural hematoma and he 
was transferred to ___.

At ___, he was admitted to the Neurosurgery service. Repeat 
Head CT showed a stable subdural hematoma size. He was placed on 
Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. He was subsequently transferred 
to the Medicine service.

On the Medicine service, he was found to have positive 
orthostatics, and his Lisinopril was stopped. His telemetry was 
negative for any arrhythmia, and his EKG showed no concerning 
changes. He had a recent TTE in ___, so repeat echo was 
not pursued. His fall was felt to be more likely due to 
orthostasis rather than syncope, so Lisinopril will be stopped 
on discharge. His symptoms of post-fall confusion are likely due 
to a concussion, and should improve with time, but he should 
report to care if any worsening neurologic changes or further 
falls.

He was seen by both ___ and OT while in house, and he was cleared 
for home, with no need for Rehab or outpatient ___.  He will 
return home where he has assistance from home health aides.

CHRONIC ISSUES
=======================
# Atrial Fibrillation
- Continue home Metoprolol
- Not on anticoagulation due to fall risk

# HLD - continue Lovastatin

# Dementia - continue Donepezil

# Depression - continue Nortryptiline.  Considered downtitration 
of this med given fall risk, but deferred given history of 
significant depression.

# CHF with preserved EF - continue Furosemide

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=======================
[ ] Lisinopril was STOPPED due to low-normal BP's, positive 
orthostatics, and fall risk
[ ] At next PCP visit, please RECHECK ORTHOSTATICS to ensure 
normalization. If still positive, consider d/c or decreasing 
Lasix and/or Metoprolol
[ ] He will continue Keppra 500mg BID x5 additional days to 
complete a seven day course for seizure prophylaxis, last day 
___
[ ] He will follow up with ___ clinic in 4 weeks for 
office visit and repeat head CT
[ ] Downtitrating his Nortryptiline to prevent falls and 
sedation was considered, but deferred, given there were multiple 
primary care notes of worsening depression when this medication 
was adjusted

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  You were admitted to 
our hospital after you fell.  You were taken in to your doctor's 
office, where a CAT scan showed a small bleed in your head.  
Fortunately, on repeat CAT scan, the bleed was stable, and not 
increasing in size.

You have been started on a medication called Keppra, to prevent 
the risk of having a seizure.  This can be stopped after the 
prescription finishes - you need to take it for 5 more days, 
twice per day.

Some of your fogginess and confusion about the fall is likely 
due to a small concussion.  This should slowly improve with 
time.

If you develop worsening headache, confusion, or further falls, 
please report to the Emergency Room.

We have also stopped your Lisinopril, because your blood 
pressure was somewhat low, and low blood pressures can increase 
the risk of falls.

Please follow up with your doctors as ___ below.

We wish you all the best,
___ Medicine Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the 
Operating Room where she underwent a left robotic-assisted wedge 
resection of left upper lobe cancer, mediastinal lymph node 
sampling and lysis of adhesions. She tolerated the procedure 
well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.  She 
maintained stable hemodynamics and her pain was controlled with 
IV Dilaudid.  Her ___ tube drained a small amount of thin 
bloody fluid and had an air leak.  Her initial chest xray showed 
poor reexpansion of the left lung but this improved over 24 
hours.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to 
progress well.  Her ___ drain was removed on post op day #1 as 
her air leak resolved, the drainage was minimal and her lung had 
reexpanded on chest xray. She was up and walking steadily but 
unfortunately was unable to wean from oxygen.  Her room air 
saturations were in the low to mid 80's with ambulation.  On 2 
LPM at rest she was 92-94%.  She was using her incentive 
spirometer though had low volumes. Her pain was controlled with 
Tylenol and occasional Oxycodone. Her port sites were healing 
well.

She was hospitalized for an additional day for pulmonary toilet 
but was still unable to wean from oxygen. Her hematocrit was 34, 
her chest xray showed no signs of CHF and her BNP was 248. Her 
xray did show a loculated left pneumothorax and basilar 
atelectasis.  

Plans for short term home oxygen were made as well as ___ 
services for cardiopulmonary assessment and oxygen weaning. She 
was discharged to home on ___ and will follow up in the 
Thoracic cli9nic with a chest xray prior in 2 weeks.

Final Report 
HISTORY: ___ male with metastatic pancreatic cancer, 
undergoing 
chemotherapy. Now presenting with leukocytosis and fever, 
without a 
definitive source. Evaluate for possible intra-abdominal 
abscess. 
  
TECHNIQUE: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV and p.o. contrast. 
MDCT-acquired 
axial images from the base of the neck to the pubic symphysis 
are displayed in 
5-mm slice thickness. Sagittally and coronally reformatted 
images are 
displayed in 5- mm slice thickness. 
  
COMPARISON: CT torso with IV contrast on ___. 
  
FINDINGS: 
  
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a small pleural effusion on 
the right. 
There is new hazy-patchy opacity of the right lung base, and 
similar hazy- 
patchy opacity in lesser degree at the left lung base. These 
findings are 
likely atelectasis, but superinfection cannot be ruled out. 
  
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: In the liver, the known metastasis 
are slightly 
larger in size compared to the prior study. There is linear 
hypodensity, 
representing either biliary dilation or extension of tumor. The 
mass seen at 
the tail of the pancreas, measuring 2.5 cm x 3 cm, is not 
significantly 
different from the prior study. Again seen is tumor encasing of 
splenic 
artery. 
  
There are bilateral polycystic kidneys with multiple large 
cysts. Some of the 
cysts have high Hounsfield unit, may represent hemorrhagic 
cysts. However, 
metastasis or primary tumor cannot be excluded. There is no 
significant 
lymphadenopathy seen in the abdomen. There is no evidence of 
intra-abdominal 
abscess. There is no free fluid in the abdomen. 
  
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is contrast seen in the colon 
with normal 
fecal matter and gas. The small bowel appears normal. There is a 
small 
calcific density seen in the mesocolon subjacent to the 
abdominal wall without 
soft tissue involvement. This finding likely represents a 
nonspecific 
calcified lymph node. There is no evidence of pelvic abscess. 
There is no 
free fluid in the pelvis. 
  
BONES: There are degenerative changes in the lower lumbar. There 
is no 
suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion. 
  
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo Male w/ advanced pancreatic cancer presenting to clinic 
line infection, anemia, and hyperglycemia.  
  
Comfort Measures: ___ down with family and pt with palliative 
team to discuss management based on pt's CT scans. Pt and family 
members state that he would like to be comfortable and avoid any 
interventions that would prolong life without quality 
improvement. Pt is now DNR/DNI comfort measures. Pt is currently 
on a PO regimen of MS ___ for baseline pain control and PO 
Morphine Instant Release for breakthrough pain. Pt prefers oral 
pain medication over IV medication. Pt also complained of some 
anxiety overnight, frequency of ativan increased to every 6 
hours tohelp.

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: ___ right upper lobe, posterior aspect of 
first rib, 11R lymph nodes, 12R lymph nodes, level 7 lymph 
nodes, 4R lymph nodes, 2R lymph nodes.
DIAGNOSIS: 
  I.  Posterior aspect of 1st rib (A):
No carcinoma seen.
 II.  12R lymph nodes (B):
Multiple lymph node fragments, no carcinoma seen.
III.  11R lymph nodes (C):
Multiple lymph node fragments, no carcinoma seen.
IV.  Level 7 lymph nodes (D):
One lymph node, no carcinoma seen.
 V.  4R lymph nodes (E):

VII.  Lung, right upper lobe, lobectomy and partial chest wall 
resection (G-P):
a.  No residual viable tumor seen.
Part 7 is additionally labeled ""right upper lobe"" and consists 
of a lung lobectomy with partial chest wall resection which 
measures 18 x 12 x 7 cm. The portion of lung measures 15 x 10 x 
6 cm and the portion of chest wall which includes segments of 
ribs 1, 2, 3, 4 measures 9 x 8 x 2.5 cm. There is a long stitch 
indicating the T1 nerve root and a short stitch indicating the 
posterior chest wall margin. The segment of lung is grossly 
adherent to the internal surface of the chest wall.  The segment 
of lung is sectioned to reveal a firm gray white mass measuring 
2.8 cm in greatest dimension and grossly abutting the soft 
tissues of the internal chest wall at the area of adhesion.  No 
gross invasion of tumor into ribs is identified.  The area 
marked as the posterior chest wall margin is grossly free of 
tumor.  The remainder of the lung parenchyma is grossly 
unremarkable.  

CHEST (PA & LAT)  ___ 
FINDINGS: Three views of the chest are compared to ___. 
The final right apical chest tube has been removed and there is 
a small persistent right apical pneumothorax that is unchanged 
or slightly decreased in size. Relatively clear. The pulmonary 
vasculature is normal. The heart and mediastinal contours are 
stable. Small subcutaneous emphysema continues to improve.
IMPRESSION: Persistent stable/slightly improved right apical 
pneumothorax status post final chest tube removal.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted on ___ and underwent successful 
Right thoracotomy, en bloc chest wall resection with right upper 
lobectomy, mediastinal lymph node
lymphadenectomy.  He was monitored in the PACU prior to transfer 
to the floor with 2 chest tubes and a foley in place.  His pain 
was well controlled via a Bupivacaine epidural and Dilaudid PCA 
managed by the acute pain service.  On POD #1 he was transfused 
with 2 units of PRBC for a HCT of 25 to a HCT of 33.  The chest 
tubes were found to have an air leak and remained on wall 
suction. His diet was advanced as tolerated. On POD #2 the 
chest-tubes were placed to water seal with a persistent air leak 
which was followed by serial chest x-rays.  POD ___ the 
chest-tube remained, his pain was well controlled and he 
ambulated in the halls.  On POD #5 the anterior chest-tube was 
removed, the Dilaudid PCA was converted to PO pain meds.  On POD 
#6 the epidural and foley were removed. On POD #7 the remainder 
chest-tube was removed and his CXR revealed a small persistent 
stable right apical pneumothorax.  His RA saturations were 96%.  
His pain was not well managed with PO Dilaudid and was changed 
to OxyContin & Oxycodone with good results. He was constipated 
and given multiple laxatives with good results. CXR revealed 
right pleural effusion which was tapped for 200cc. his cough was 
productive for thick brown sputum and WBC rose from 13 to 18. He 
was started on levaquin. WBC decreased to 12.3 and remianed 
afebrile. He was discharged to home on POD #10.  He will 
follow-up with ___ NP in ___ in one week to assess pul 
status and wound check.
