Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
============================
___ with PMH HTN, HLD, nephrolithiasis s/p lithotripsy 1 month 
ago, called by PCP to go to ED for hyperglycemia on routine 
labs, who was later found to have non-ketotic hyperglycemia 
suggestive of new onset diabetes, without a clear acute inciting 
factor. He was started on insulin therapy for his very elevated 
blood glucose levels, and a close follow-up plan was created, 
after inpatient adjustment of his insulin regimen to reduce 
risks of hypoglycemia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
============================

#Type II DM:
As per PCP note, pt has recently been experiencing 1 month of 
blurry vision, extreme thirst, polyuria, and 14#wt loss in ___ yr. 
On routine labs sent by PCP HbA1c was ~10, and Glc was >500 so 
he was referred to ED. Pt noted to have non-ketotic 
hyperglycemia w/ Glc>800 (AG14, pH7.3), so was fluid 
resuscitated, and given sliding scale coverage which resolved 
his hyperglycemia and ___ saw pt in ED, and felt was 
medically stable, but unsafe for d/c as he did not understand 
how to administer medications. As per ___ rec's, qHs Lantus 
was uptitrated to 20U over the next two days, Metformin was 
started at 500mg BID, and pt was covered w/ HISS. Diabetes 
educator spent time with patient teaching him how to 
administer/dose insulin. On day of discharge, fasting FSG was 
160 before breakfast.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
============================

#HTN:
Pt was continued on home dose Amlodipine to good effect.

#HLD:
In reviewing outpatient lab work, pt's recent lipid profile (LDL 
153/HDL34), and new diagnosis of T2DM (CAD equivalent) suggest 
that he would benefit from statin therapy. Accordingly, he will 
need to discuss risks/benefits of use, and consider intiation of 
therapy as an outpatient. 

Transitional Issues:
===========================
1. Pt will need to follow up with his outpatient PCP to have 
___ titrated.
2. Pt will need to check his fasting FSG daily each morning and 
keep a log of the values so dosing can be adjusted.
3. Pt will need routine screening of eyes/feet yearly. 
4. Pt will need continued advisement/encouragement re: wt loss 
in order to further improve his glycemic control.
5. Given recent lipid panel (LDL 153/HDL34/Tri544) and new 
diagnosis of diabetes (CAD equivalent), would consider adding 
statin to medication regimen as an outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with a history of EtOH/HBV/HDV cirrhosis 
s/p TIPS (___), baseline MELD ___, on transplant list with 
myalgias and found to have hyperkalemia in the setting of 
worsened renal function. He was given fluids and diuretics were 
held with improvement.

# Hyperkalemia - K of 5.4 at admission. Normalized after 2L NS 
in the ED and holding diuretics. Likely due to pre-renal 
azotemia. He perhaps has decreasing diuretic need following his 
TIPS. 

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Likely pre-renal due to 
overdiuresis given resolved with 2L NS. He does not have other 
signs of decompensated cirrhosis, so hepatorenal syndrome is 
less likely. His Cr remained stable at 1.4 at discharge.

# Myalgias and cramps - Appears chronic. Improved without 
intervention. Flu swab was negative. EKG was nonischemic.  He 
was started on magnesium oxide supplementation at discharge.

# HBV/EtOH Cirrhosis: Appeared to be compensated. His MELD was 
stable at 28. He was continued on home regimen except for 
diuretics.

recurrent UTI. She was admitted to the Transplant Surgery 
Service. Urine and blood cultures were sent. She was started on 
Linezolid, Meropenum and Flagyl empirically. Fevers abated. WBC 
dropped to 1.3 on hospital day 2. ID was consulted and 
recommendations to switch Flagyl to po vanco to eliminate the 
WBC suppression. Vanco po continued for 4 days. Stool was 
negative for c.diff.  EBV and CMV VLs were sent. CMV was 
negative and EBV was negative to date. CXR demonstrated 
resolution of previous pneumonia. 

UA was positive. Urine cx from ___ isolated multidrug resistant 
E.coli. Linezolid stopped on 3.9. Meropenum continued for 4 days 
stopping on ___ when this was switched to Imipenem on ___. Per 
ID, Ertapenum was not an option in place of meropenum as there 
is a 50% chance of resistance to E. coli with Ertapenum.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a ___
right-handed man with history of hypertension and
hyperlipidemia, who was asymptomatic at 3 p.m. on ___, who was working as a ___ at the time, and after
he dropped off a passenger, as he was speaking on the phone
while sitting in his cab, he noticed that his vision became
black.  He said that the whole visual field in both eyes was
black.  He felt that his left arm was ""shaking"".  It was not
weak or numb.  He became very anxious.  He screamed, ""I am
dying.""  His friend on the other end of the phone told him to
breathe.  After a couple of deep breaths, and in about 15
seconds, his vision had returned to normal.  His left hand
was no longer having tremors.  He is not completely sure if
the visual loss was binocular or not.  He thinks that his
visual loss may have been worse in the left eye.  He did not
close 1 eye at a time to confirm if it was, in fact, both
eyes that were affected.  He also had palpitations.  He had a
fear of going blind.  He said this was the third time that
this has happened to him.  He could not remember the timing
of the prior events.  In the previous events, he had

bilaterally.  No clonus.  Toes are downgoing bilaterally.
Coordination was intact to finger-nose-finger, heel-to-shin
and rapid alternating movements bilaterally.  Gait was normal
stance and side.  Tandem was intact.  Romberg was negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 139, BUN 13, creatinine 1, potassium
4.0, chloride 104, glucose 78, bicarb 26.  Complete blood
count:  White blood cells 6.2, hemoglobin 14.6, hematocrit
42.5, platelets 201,000.

IMAGING:  He had a CAT scan of the brain on ___
that showed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
midline shift, mass effect or acute large vascular
territorial infarct.  Gray-white matter differentiation is
preserved.  There is no hydrocephalus.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.

CT angiogram of the head and neck on ___:
1. CTA head demonstrates moderate calcified atherosclerotic
    disease in the cavernous segments of the internal
    carotid arteries but no evidence of flow-limiting
    stenosis, occlusion, dissection or aneurysm larger than
    2 mm.
2. CTA of the neck demonstrates no evidence of significant
    sternocostal disease, pseudoaneurysm or dissection.  No
    internal carotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria.
3. Cervical spondylosis with angular kyphosis and ventral
    canal narrowing most marked at the C5-C6 level.

MRI of the brain without contrast:  Findings:  There is no
evidence of slow diffusion to suggest acute infarct.  There
is no hemorrhage, midline shift, mass effect or extraocular
fluid collection.  There are multiple scattered foci on T2 and
FLAIR 
hyperintensities noted throughout the white matter,
particularly in the deep paraventricular region, likely
sequela of chronic microvascular ischemic change.

Adequate fluid voids are seen in the major intracranial
vessels.  There is mild mucosal thickening of the paranasal
sinuses without air/fluid levels.  The mastoid air cells are
clear.  The orbits and soft tissues are grossly unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial process
including no evidence of acute infarction.

Electrocardiogram:  Baseline artifact, sinus rhythm.
Nondiagnostic T waves in leads 3 and aVF.  Early R-wave
progression.  No previous tracing available for comparison.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  When the patient was admitted to the
___  ___ Department, a code stroke
was called at 6:29 p.m.  His ___ stroke scale at that time
was zero.  IV tPA was not given or considered because he had
an ___ stroke scale of only zero.  His CAT scan of the brain
showed no evidence of hemorrhage or infract.  He was admitted
to the Neurology Service.  He was continued on aspirin 325 mg
daily.  His blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate.  The
following morning, when he was interviewed, he described that
on ___ at 3 p.m., that as he was talking on the phone,
he had lost vision starting from the left-hand side, and then
moving over to cover both eyes.  He could not see for several
seconds, and his vision completely resolved.  He had
palpitations at that time.  He described left-hand tremors but
not rhythmic shaking.  The left-hand tremors happened for a
few seconds.  He was afraid he might die.  He was still able
to speak on the telephone.

His neuro examination on ___ was intact and
nonfocal.  His brief episode of bilateral vision loss lasted
only seconds.  It was considered highly unlikely to be a
transient ischemic attack in the absence of other focal neuro
findings.  He had described some tremors of his left hand,
tensing of his left arm, but this did not sound like rhythmic
shaking, and seems improbable to be a seizure.  Also, his
vision loss is a negative symptom, whereas seizures usually
provoke positive symptoms.  This was not an episode of
syncope, since he was still able to speak on the phone.
Presyncope is a possibility.  He was monitored with telemetry
and this did not show an arrhythmia that might have
precipitated a presyncope episode.  This episode seems more
likely to have been a panic attack.  He described similar
episodes of transient bilateral vision loss with
palpitations, difficulty breathing and the feeling of dying
in the past.  He should continue his aspirin 325 mg daily.
He should get an  echocardiogram as an outpatient to help
evaluate for possible causes of syncope.  He had no
difficulties with walking or swallowing.

He was discharged back to his home, and he was set up with
outpatient followup with Dr. ___. He was also set up for an
outpatient transthoracic echocardiogram. He will be seeing Dr.
___ on ___ at 2:30 p.m.
