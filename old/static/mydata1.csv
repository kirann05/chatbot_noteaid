FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates nodular contour with coarse 
echotexture,
consistent with known history of cirrhosis. Again seen is a 
2.6-cm cyst with septation in the left hepatic lobe, unchanged 
since the prior study. A second solid lesion seen in the segment 
II of the liver, is not imaged in the current study. The patient 
is status post-cholecystectomy. There is no intrahepatic biliary 
dilatation. The common bile duct measures 7 mm. There is no free 
fluid.
 
Color Doppler and pulse Doppler images were obtained. The main 
portal vein
has normal hepatopetal flow. The TIPS shunt is patent and 
demonstrates
wall-to-wall flow. The flow velocities in the proximal, mid and 
distal portion of the TIPS are 122, 144, 149 cm/sec 
respectively. Flow in the left portal vein was directed towards 
the shunt.
 
IMPRESSION: Patent TIPS shunt with wall to wall flow. Expected 
hepatopedal
flow in the main and hepatofugal flow in the left portal vein. 
No ascites.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Lower GI Bleed - Although stools were guiac positve in house, it 
was unlikely that she has had a significant GI bleed and she 
remained hemodyanmically stable throughout her hospitalization 
without additional episodes of melena or hematochezia. It was 
more likely that she may have slow, not hemodyanmically 
significant, oozing that presisted despite TIPS procedure. Liver 
ultrasound revealed patent TIPS with normal flow.  Received 1 U 
PRBC transfusion prior to discharge for a HCT of 23.8. 
*Should reassess CBC on follow up

Alcohol use: Patient continues to abuse alcohol, evidenced by 
her intoxicated presentation and BAL of 191 on admission. Social 
work was consulted to offer additional information about 
available services, although patient declined. She had no 
symptoms of withdrawal during this admission she was maintained 
on an oral MVI, thiamine and folate supplement.  Urged patient 
to continue alcohol cessation, although she claims she uses it 
for pain management as her pain is ""poorly controlled"".  Of 
note, refused Tyelenol in house for pain relief.   
*Assess for alcohol abstinence 

Alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy: Her admission 
MELD was 6. She has no previous ascites on ultrasound, none was 
evident on admission. She did not appear to have decompensated 
cirrhosis. Her lactulose dose was titrated to achieve 3 bowel 
movements daily and she was continued on her home rifaximin 
dose. She was also continued on her home pantoprazole dose.
.
Pancytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis. All Levels were elevated on 
admission in the setting of hemoconcentration and normalized to 
her outpatient baseline following hydration.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  Continues to drink alcohol.  Very tearful 
and emotional over necessity of taking lactulose.  Also 
unsatisfied with pain control for tooth pain, although 
procedures were over 2 weeks ago and should have minimal pain as 
appear well healed.  Refused Tyelonol in house and requested 
narcotics.  Held narcotics due to mental status changes that 
could occur.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, she underwent Segment V mass resection and 
intraoperative ultrasound for hepatic adenoma. An epidural was 
placed for pain control. Surgeon was Dr. ___. 
Operative findings were noted: solitary mass in segment V of the 
liver that on gross appearance looked like a hepatic adenoma. 
Frozen section confirmed probable hepatic adenoma. 
Intraoperative ultrasound demonstrated no other lesions in the 
liver. Intraoperative ultrasound after the mass was enucleated 
demonstrated no residual tumor tissue. Please refer to operative 
note for details. Postop, epidural was ineffective for pain 
control. IV Morphine was given then switched to IV dilaudid with 
improved control. The epidural was removed on ___. 

She spiked a temperature to 101 on postop day 1 attributed to 
atelectasis, but blood cultures were sent and were negative to 
date. UA was negative and urine culture was negative. 

LFTs increased slightly then trended down. Diet was slowly 
advanced. She was assisted to ambulate and needed a lot of 
encouragement to do this as well as with the incentive 
spirometer. The incision remained intact, clean and dry. 

On ___, she became dizzy, desat'd to ___ with increased heart 
rate to 120. This improved once back in bed. A CXR was done 
noting near-complete collapse of the right lower lobe presumably 
due to mucus plugging. Aggressive incentive spirometer was 
encouraged. She remained overnight for observation. Augmentin 
was started for RLL pneumonia. O2 sats improved as well as 
dizziness. Other vitals were stable. 

She was discharged to home on Augmentin in stable condition. A 
script for oral dilaudid was provided. She was encouraged to 
decrease the dose.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ w/ h/o HTN, HLD, ?___ p/w sudden onset 
confusion and found to have hypertensive emergency.

# Acute hypertensive encephalopathy: Had word finding 
difficulty, without other focal findings. Neuro c/s thought 
unlikely to be stroke. Most likely due to hypertensive 
encephalopathy. DDx include hypertensive encephalopathy vs. 
metabolic/toxic vs. PRES vs. CVA vs infection vs. delirium vs. 
medication-induced. Infectious cause less likely given UA and 
CXR negative. TSH normal and RPR negative on last admission. 
NCHCT and CTA not concerning for acute stroke. MRI showed no 
acute hemorrhage or ischemic injury. Since pt has had similar 
presentations in the past (expressive aphasia) and 
confusion/disorientation w/ hypertension and ischemic w/u has 
been negative, this is most likely d/t hypertension as well. 
PRES less likely given headaches are frontal, no VS, no seizure. 
At time of discharge, his mental status improved but he still 
occasionally was confused and forgetful with word finding 
difficulties.

# Hypertensive emergency: BP initially elevated to 220 systolic. 
Treated in the MICU initially with IV labetalol in addition to 
restarting home meds. Most likely d/t poor compliance with 
medications v secondary causes of HTN. When transferred to the 
floor, his home atenolol was replaced with labetalol for better 
blood pressure effect and uptitrated as needed and his 
lisinopril was uptitrated to 40mg from 20mg. His isosorbide 
mononitrate was uptitrated. He was started on nifedipine as 
well. On discharge BPs were 130s-150s. Goal SBP 130-160mmHg. 

# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin 

# Anemia: H&H at baseline. Most likely d/t vit B12 deficiency. 
continue vit B12. 

# Chronic diastolic CHF: TTE done in ___ did not show any 
sign of CHF. EF>55% with mild MR and mild pulmonary HTN. Based 
on records, Lasix and metolazone are most likely for ___ edema. 
His home diuretics were held on discharge because patient was 
euvolemic during this admission. Also, he had ___ with acute 
rise in creatinine after re-starting his diuretics.

# Shoulder/back pain: History of disc herniation and shoulder 
pain. Patient is treated with Tylenol prn for pain. Narcotics 
were avoided given altered mental status. 

Transitional issues:
- medication compliance
- f/u as outpatient whether to re-start metolazone and 
- Follow urine/plasma metanephrines
- give 20mg PO hydralazine if SBP >180mmHg
- give 20mg IV hydralazine if SBP >200mmHg and notify MD
- uptitrate nifedipine v. isosorbide mononitrate as needed for 
improved BP control.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was brought to ___ for trauma 
evaluation. A chest tube was in place on the left side upon 
arrival. He was resuscitated per ACLS protocol in the trauma bay 
and determined to have hypotension, a positive fast exam and a 
rigid abdomen. After receiving antibiotics and tetanus, he was 
taken emergently to the operating room for a laparotomy. See 
operative report for full details. After a brief stay in the 
PACU, he was transferred to the floor.

Neuro: The patient received a dilaudid PCA with good effect and 
adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient 
was transitioned to oral pain medications. He continued to have 
difficulty mobilizing due to pain and toradol was added to his 
pain regimen briefly.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. He was placed 
on telemetry postoperatively and this was discontinued on POD2.

Pulmonary: The patient arrived with a left sided chest tube in 
place. Output was routinely monitored and CXR was obtained daily 
to monitor for pneumothorax. He remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. On ___, his chest tube 
was removed. Repeat CXR showed no reaccumulation of his 
pneumothorax.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. Foley was 
removed on POD2. The patient failed to void x2, foley was 
replaced, and he was given flomax. Another voiding trial was 
attempted on POD3 which was successful. The patient was 
subsequently able to void spontaneously.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. He received 
perioperative doses of cefazolin, flagyl and fluconazole.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible. He also received protonix 
for ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient worked with physical therapy during his stay to 
improve his strength and mobility. At the time of discharge, he 
was afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, walking without assistance, and with his 
pain well controled.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY.

This is a ___ with DM2 (a1c 7.8), HTN, chronic kidney disease, 
prostate cancer, sickle cell trait, mild transaminitis  with 
prior heavy alcohol use, and recent urinary tract obstruction 
thought due to BPH s/p foley catheterization, who presented with 
hematuria and bladder outlet obstruction, found to have UTI. He 
was treated with 3 way foley and CBI until clots cleared. Foley 
was then removed to limit further trauma and he passed a voiding 
trial prior to discharge. He was treated with IV antibiotics for 
UTI, transitioned to cipro on discharge.

DETAILED SUMMARY.

# Groin pain
# Hematuria with
# Bladder outlet obstruction
# UTI: He was admitted to ___ ___ for obstructive uropathy. A 
foley was placed at that time and he had improvement in renal 
function and he was discharged with outpatient followup. Now 
coming in with gross hematuria with clots obstructing foley. DDx 
foley trauma, friability from prior radiation, new cancer, 
hemorrhagic infectious cystitis. Improved with CBI via 3 way 
foley. Due to concerns for cystitis, foley was removed. He 
passed a voiding trial prior to discharge. He was treated with 
IV CTX initially but is being discharged on cipro as urine 
culture showed pansusceptible Klebsiella. 
- Complete course of cipro
- Follow up with ___ urology as below

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr is 1.5-1.8, was up 
to 2.4 two weeks ago when he had the initial obstructive 
uropathy. It had apparently improved and he had been restarted 
on his Lasix/Lisinopril a few days ago. Creatinine down to 1.5 
prior to discharge. Held Lasix and Lisinopril here given 
recurrent ___.
- Continuing to hold diuretic/ACE at discharge

# Acute blood loss anemia: Initially mildly anemic but Hb 
progressively decreasedto 7 range and then remained stable. 
Never required transfusion. Likely related to acute blood loss, 
though could have mild underlying anemia of chronic disease in 
setting of CKD. Asymptomatic including with ambulation.

# HTN
# HL: Stable. Continued atorvastatin. Continued atorvastatin. 
Continued amlodipine and metoprolol, but increased amlodipine to 
10mg for BP control while off ACE/diuretic.

# DM2 now with hyperglycemia: Takes glipizide at home. Had some 
FSBGs >300 here but improved with adjustments to insulin. 
Hyperglycemia may be related to underlying infection, improved. 
Resumed glipizide at discharge.

>30 minutes spent coordinating discharge home

 CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 11:41 AM 
No evidence of acute fracture. Extensive posterior osteophytes 
and 
calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C5-C6 
causes moderate- to-severe spinal canal narrowing. This can 
predispose the patient to cord injury in the appropriate 
clinical setting. If further imaging is warranted, MRI can be 
considered.

residuals (>500cc). This was thought to be ___ enlarged 
prostate. It appears that this also contributed to acute renal 
failure on presentation. Foley catheter was placed and Cr 
normalized. Patient also started on finasteride. He has follow 
up with urology and will need further outpatient evaluation.
